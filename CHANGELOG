Features
  * Parameterized Segments
    - parameterized segments start with a `:`
    - bugfix from radix: named parameters at the same nesting level can
      have different names

  * Glob Segments
    - glob segments will match any part of a URL and start with a `*`
    - bugfix from radix: globs don't _need_ to swallow the entire url,
      but can be placed in the middle of a url, eg: /path/*/path/

  * When multiple routes are matched, they're sorted by insertion order
    and the first is returned.
